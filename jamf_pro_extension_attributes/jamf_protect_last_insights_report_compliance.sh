# Purpose:              Extension Attribute for checking the Jamf Protect agent's latest Insights report submission and whether it cocurred within the permitted time skew
#                       This value can be used in various limiting access workflows. Expected values are:
#                       - "Protect binary not found"
#                       - "Compliant"
#                       - "Not Compliant"
#
# Please Note:          The default permitted time skew in this script for a successful Insights report is 1 week.

################ Configuration ################
# The default permitted time skew for the Insights report is 1 week.  This can be adjusted as desired (S = second, M = minute, H = hour, d = day, w = week, m = month), see the -v flag in the /bin/date manual page for more details
# Note that the default Insights report frequency in Jamf Protect is daily (1440 minutes) so the minimum configuration should ideally be 2D
